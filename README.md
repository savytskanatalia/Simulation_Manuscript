# Simulation_Manuscript
Generalized scripts used for simulation and subsequent benchmarking of the various TE expression tools.


Updated repository. 
Scripts used for simulation were moved to a separate simulation subfolder. A bash helper script added.
Additional helper scripts, e.g. for converting .fa to .fq, were added.
